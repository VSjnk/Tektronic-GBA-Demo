This is just a rough draft at the moment...

There are many tools provided under the GNU General Public License.
However, that license only takes effect if you redistribute DevKit
Advance.  There is absolutely no requirement that the source code to
any game produced by the DevKit be placed under the GPL.

The Gameboy Advance SP Windows icons are copyrighted 2003 All Rights
Reserved by Jason Wilkins.  All Rights Reserved means I am not providing
you a license for them.  I made them for DevKit Advance so please ask
my permission if you want to use them in a non-personal project.

There are various tools like headit, bin2o, and dack.  These tools are
provided under a BSD style license which merely requires that the
copyright notice and standard disclaimers are not removed from the source
code.  For the binaries, I only ask that the origin of the binaries not
be misrepresented.

One exception is interflip, which uses a copy of the ELF data structure
from the GNU BFD library.  For that reason, interflip is licensed under
the GPL.

newlib (libc) is under a BSD style license, but it requires that credit
be given even when distributing a binary version of the library.
I intrepret that to mean that if you distribute a commercial game which
uses newlib, then you should include in the instruction manual that the
game includes source code from the various sources listed in the license.

The source code provided with DevKit Advance in the crtls and devkitadv
directories is all under that same BSD style license as the binary tools.
crt0.S and lnkscript contain a copy of this license, but it also applies 
to all the other source in those directories.

The documentation is licensed under the GNU Free Documentation License.
